# Image-Classification
# Problem Statement
The objective of the project is to implement a simple image classification based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

# Dataset Description
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

The images come in two formats as follows.

Format 1 : Original images with character level bounding boxes.

Format 2 : MNIST-like 32-by-32 images centered around a single character (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides).
